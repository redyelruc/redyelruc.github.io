## **Contributing**

**How to contribute**

I'm always looking for collaborations and particularly welcome from developers looking to improve the existing code or add new features

## Submitting changes

Please send a pull request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)). When you send a pull request, please make sure that there is only one feature added/changed per commit. Please attach a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## **Changelog**

A detailed changelog, intended for programmers

## **Bugs**

Currently no known bugs.


## Thanks
